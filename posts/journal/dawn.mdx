summary: I turn the faucet all the way to the right for the last few seconds of my shower – a ritual I have taken up this past winter. The practice reminds me of high school when I didn’t have the luxury of steamy personal bathrooms but rather run-down swaths of stalls – some of which didn’t work entirely.
