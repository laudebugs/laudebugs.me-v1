I sink Into patterns, A slow agony of todos and expectations, Demanding of me, wanting from me, What I do not seem to have, but questions of: What not to do, what to prioritize, When to sleep? What to want? What is necessary? Seem to blur into each other. How can I answer all these and take care of my mind, remember to eat, run, laugh and pray? But isn’t this struggle the whole point of life – friend remarks. And so I dive, into the depths, finding myself often in places my senses are muted. Do I have the courage to fall is the all important question.
