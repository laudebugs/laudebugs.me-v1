title: A Meditation on 24
publishedOn: '2020-10-17'
author: Laurence Ininda
summary: 'Twenty-four
1. is slow, is fast, is blurry and gets lost often, in its becoming.
2. It has no ring to it, no newness, no uniqueness.
3. Everything is mundane with rabid desires and ugly hair in odd places.
4. Memory remains of the past and the future is yet one day at a time.
5. One day at a time. How much further can I look but one day at a time.
