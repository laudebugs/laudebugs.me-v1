title: 'Organizing Codebases with Automation Tools'
publishedOn: '2021-11-17'
author: 'Laurence Ininda'
summary: "JavaScript or TypeScript codebases can be a hustle to manage. Some people like their spacebars a lot more than their tabs; How can we track changes effectively on each commit? Or how can we automate versioning? We all can do with some standards in our codebase that allow us to keep track of what's going on in them."

<Aside>
  Over the past couple of months, shuffling between different projects, and also work, I found it particularly useful to have some standard
  way to organize a codebase - even if each of the projects differed in some way or another. This little guide is what I come back to
  whenever I'm scaffolding a new project.

## Tools Mentioned in this guide

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Commitlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli)
- [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)
- [Standard Version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version)

### [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

Husky is used to make our commits more cool, and powerful to help development easier. In this guide, husky will be used to format both the files (source code) and commits themselves before they are executed (thus "pre" in the pre-commit hooks).

[Read more here.](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

- [Initialize Husky:](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=automatic-recommended)

  ```bash
  npx husky-init && yarn
  ```

## Prettier & EsLint

If we would like to have our commits automatically format our code on every commit - to ensure that the codebase follows a specified standard, defined in the `prettierrc` file, then this is a handy tool to have.

1. Add Prettier and eslint to your project:

   ```bash
     # prettier
     yarn add prettier --dev
     # or
     npm i -D prettier

     # eslint
     yarn add eslint --dev
     # or
     npm i -D eslint
   ```

2. Add a prettier [config file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) to the repository - named `.prettierrc.json` (or following the [specified format](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) for configuration files:

   ```json
   {
     "trailingComma": "all",
     "tabWidth": 4,
     "semi": false,
     "singleQuote": true
     //more rules below
   }
   ```

3. Initialize EsLint:

   ```bash
   yarn run eslint --init
   # or
   npm run eslint --init
   ```

4. Set up ESLint to work with prettier

   Add prettier plugin to the eslint configuration file:

   ```json
   // .eslintrc.json
   {
     "extends": [
       // other extensions,
       "prettier"
     ]
   }
   ```

   Now, you can specify prettier rules to work with your linter and not have both ESLint and Prettier enforcing different styles

5. Add [Prettier Pre-commit Hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html#docsNav):

   ```bash
   yarn add --dev pretty-quick
   # or
   npm i -D pretty-quick

   yarn husky set .husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"
   # or
   npm run husky set ./husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"
   ```

> There are more ways to configure your prettier pre-commit hooks [found here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html#docsNav).

## [CommitLint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) & CommitLint Hooks

Commitlint is a tool that lints commits - and make sure they are up to standard.
We will also add a husky pre-commit hook that lints our commit messages

1. [Install Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#getting-started)

   ```bash
   # Install commitlint cli and conventional config
   yarn add --dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}
   # For Windows:
   yarn add --dev @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli

   # Configure commitlint to use conventional config
   echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js
   ```

2. . Add the commitlint hooks:

   ```bash
   # Install Husky v6
   npm install husky --save-dev
   # or
   yarn add husky --dev

   # Add hook
   npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
   ```

3. Add a husky pre-commit hook config to the package.json
   ```json
     "husky": {
       "hooks": {
         "prepare-commit-msg": "exec < /dev/tty && git cz --hook || true"
       }
     }
   ```

## [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

Commitizen is a command line interface tool that can be helpful in making commits a pretty-forward process following your linting rules.

1.  Install the tool

    ```bash
    yarn add -D commitizen
    # or
    npm i -D commitizen
    ```

2.  Add a script to the package.json to easily run commitizen:

            ```json
            //...
              "scripts": {
                "commit": "cz"
              }
            // ...
            ```

        An Example use:

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MechanicalHuman/hnp-utilities/master/packages/commitizen-adapter/hero.png">

    [source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hnp/cz/v/1.0.7)

> You can customize the fields available in your commitizen CLI by [following this guide](https://medium.com/vlad-arbatov/development-how-to-adapt-a-custom-conventional-changelog-33ff3b13c832)

## Conventional Changelog

This will assist in generating changelogs automatically from commits:

1. Initialize:
   ```bash
   npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exac
   ```

## Versioning and Release

We can use [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#standard-version) to automatically generate versions for out projects.

1.  Install Standard Version

    ```bash
    yarn add --dev standard-version
    # or
    npm i --save-dev standard-version

    ```

2.  Add scripts to easily run releases and generate changelogs automaticallly:

        ```json
        {
          "scripts": {
            "release": "standard-version"
          }
        }
        ```

    Another option to Standard version is [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

You can now run your first release by:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```

> Plug: Here is an example of a [changelog for my website](https://www.laudebugs.me/changelog).

If you create a release - then you can push that release by running:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```
