In the dust there lays some sense of what was past, what was forgotten and what was lost. My feet sink into the particles as I grab onto what are my calloused toes from too much running away from something. I dare not look back – dare not tempt the shadows that I conquered. Hair – loose and breaking I wonder if I’ll ever see its full length. Several things are amiss. I miss several things. The feeling is severe, wretched and I hold my breath.

Now would be a good time to wake up from this dream. I think I’ve slept too long and my head hurts from too much wine. I need water. Where can we find things that seem to not want to be found? With limited space, how will I know what to bring on this journey? What lies are worth believing?
