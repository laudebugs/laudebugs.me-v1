The practice reminds me of high school when I didn’t have the luxury of steamy personal bathrooms but rather run-down swaths of stalls – some of which didn’t work entirely. Toward the end of my junior year, we were lucky to have one or two of the stalls installed with running hot water – but even with the option to take a hot shower in the morning, I at times preferred the chilling water to awaken myself to a new day.</p>\n<p>Of all the past winters I’ve experienced, this past winter was also a time when I was trying to figure out my career, my faith, writing, family, friends and more. Most of that is still work in progress – I&#39;m writing again – which I’m happy about. The opportunity intern at Antra, a consulting company, has been a process of learning. I recently also became a daily coffee drinker which I didn’t ever see coming. I still convince a part of myself that it’s not an addiction.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this very past winter, the was a kind of longing that hung in the air as I moved back to New York. This longing was for the certain past – the good and the bad as well as the future – always a time to look forward to and hope. This longing was at times deep and frustrating and at other times faded amidst the daily rhythms and rituals. Past victories and failures are both in themselves alluring. The former because I can easily hold them too close and close my eyes to what lays before me, now. The latter because I can also easily jump back right into them and stimy any progress I made to learn from my mistakes. However, the most attractive thing about the past is that the past has a certainty to it – it&#39;s complete and bound up in itself. How I badly wanted that – the certainty that the past could offer.</p>\n<p>The future holds hope as an appeal. Often at times I tend to want to feed into that hope now – by doing what I can to make the future become the present. At times I don’t want to wait – why wait for something so deeply attractive as a future. The risk here is, I think far more dangerous because I may then become frustrated and dissatisfied with the work I need to do to get there. The work needed to get there remains very much so in the present. I am writing all this as a reminder to myself that the living part is very much in the now.</p>\n<p>As a side note, I’ve also been trying new recipes. Although I have tried different recipes, my beef stew isn’t quite there yet as last weekend I skipped the tomatoes and added too much water but managed to salvage a meal for my room mates.</p>\n<p>That’s it for now, but I hope to share more in the future.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

Rather than my existence being centered around the color of my skin, the question I often asked was some flavor of “how do I tell stories that portray the diversity and complexity of our people?” To answer this question, I needed to look back in order to look ahead. Although colonization was motivated by the idea of one group of people being of lesser value viewed as lower than another, this concept of caste is not only remnant but has morphed into bitter and negative ethnicity among Kenyan tribes. The color of my skin, then, was just a happenstance even as it took much more meaning in college.</p>\n<p>In general, English places adjectives before the subject unlike Swahili or French (the later that I spoke since 14), . So, what ends up happening is that in describing a person, their skin color is pointed out before we know that subject is first and foremost a person. With an attempt then, to place the person before the color of their skin (a person who is black as opposed to a black person), I witnessed the slight dissociation of skin color from becoming the defining characteristic of a person. I can therefore be a human being before I am black, I can be a man before I am black, I can be a Kenyan before I am black. Since in Kenya there was no concept of being black, I began to try to understand Black America, through conversation, the media, and readings. Back home, there is a loose concept of blackness and so, as I asked myself the question of “how do I move through this space as a black person,” I found myself having to stop and think in a state of mind that did not occur naturally to me. To have to think about the tone of my voice, the cadence of my speech, how my feet bounced off the ground, how my hands and neck revealed my body language, whether, if in fact, I was a danger to anyone was exhausting. I think of how my female friends talked about how they work against the grain of a misogynist culture, how they have to be aware of their senses because you can never be too careful. How then could I weave my identity as a person of color while sustaining my Kenyan heritage, and could the two exist in concert?</p>\n<p>It was in the fall of 2016 that I became awakened to the color my skin having implications on how I moved through spaces. More and more, I began to see how the color of one’s skin can be a reference point to the kinds of lives that could be extrapolated solely from what color that is. How black America was presented was very much a culture as well as the stories that are attached to its invention. To be black was also taking up and actualizing an identity from the color of my skin. Superficial blackness is for instance, cool, slick, having that delicate bounce and smooth swagger. The deeper work was internal – from understanding my relationship with my skin – learning how to take care of it in the cold and dry winters and reaffirming its affinity to the warm tropical weather. I was growing out my hair since the end of high school and taking delight in how it looked up with its coarse texture. And this process intrigued me, along with the idea of becoming black. An African such as I could empathize with the African American history of being enslaved and discriminated against, judged, lynched because of the color of one’s skin. But in as much as this dark history seemed to take center stage in discussions and conversations about racism against African Americans, there were stories of tremendous triumph, stories of black enterprise and far-reaching cultural movements in music, art and literature among others. Whether I could juggle these two aspects as well as discover other manifestations of the black experience remains an unresolved journey. Three realities emerged. There were environments where I became fully conscious of the color of my skin, there were also spaces where I could forget the color of my skin mattered and there were situations where the consciousness and lack thereof existed in a kind of tug of war.</p>\n<p>There is a kind of inward gaze about black America to which I observed: that the story of the black America is often centered on his experience and how that experience shapes his worldview. For me, a Kenyan who looked outward into the world, and from the outward gaze into America, the process of looking inside led me, first, to take a closer look at how I was raised and how that upbringing did, if in any way, shape my black experience; and secondly, to begin to pay attention to how I navigate different spaces and social situations and how this navigation is informed by (a) my being a man and (b) having black skin. Very quickly after I arrived in New York that Fall of 2016, I became more aware of how, as a black man, could walk the streets of New York at odd hours of the night and carry little fear – unlike some of my fellow female friends who kept mentioning the amount of caution that they exercised in the city at night. With the #MeToo movement, various celebrities, and public figures, primarily men, began facing the consequences of taking advantage of their power and influence to assault and/or take advantage of women. This calling out of men couple with conversations with others, as well as reading, began to open my eyes to the power dynamics that exist when I interact with women and how much work there still remains to be done, especially back home, for men to understand how it is also up to them, not only women, to examine the ways they are brought up to view women. While growing up there was a lack of direct conversation surrounding what it means to be a man, I took mental notes from my father who was a preacher/minister and an academic, in that order. Looking then, into my blackness, I defaulted towards my faith and my upbringing – neither of which seemed to provide adequate fodder for my nascent conceptualizations of Black America. Black America needed me, a man with black skin, to keep engaging with its gripping past to bring myself to an understanding of its present form in daily life.</p>\n<p>Toni Morrison, in her book, The Origin of Others talks about how easy it is to estrange others. I think about this idea of Othering, how many times I have made it possible for someone to feel different, how deliberate as well as easy this act can be – to not listen deeply, to make lazy assumptions, to not want to know someone’s experience, to put value to one person over another. I think again of how simple the process of seeing the world with my eyes alone. “Why should we want to close the distance when we can close the gate?” – Morrison asks. Yet, to the many who have stretched themselves to me, it has been a selfless gift as well as a humanizing and healing process. How much more, then, am I to give an ear, to take a pause, be open to another point of view, step into the discomfort and know another?</p>\n<p>Credit to one dear friend who helped me edit this piece.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

The days are now here and there marked by rain, the shrinking daylight, and later the deadening of leaves. This September my mother turns sixty. The more I remember that, the more I try to remember when she turned 50 or 45 and the kinds of things that happened in between those years and think that I would want to white out some parts and keep others. But again, it’s September and how can I not let this month pass by yet is stands between me and the rest of the year; between me and thinking of the uncertainty what’s to come. But even more so than ever, each day that is not closely watched can turn into a week and month passing by and forgotten and so I want to note that I am here now, in September, watching the birds make their enclaves outside my window the heat claiming more of the morning and the people stepping into their forays. Oh, but how can I grab on to this month and not let it slip?</p>\n<p>I begin a schedule – early mornings and perhaps I won’t spend too much time thinking about regressing into lax streaks. I’m trying to bring our conversations down to earth with a friend because they risk being over there and not in the moment and wonder how to do this without being too introspective. I am reading, and writing, listening, learning to get across what I mean to say. Tomorrow I will run. Though there’s still today that just only began. Only just reared its head and let’s deal with this day first.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

As we speak, my intention is to learn more about her and that, eventually, she can learn more about me. She shares stories of how she met my father and studied in America. She tells me of her joyous and happy moments as well as her struggles and mistakes. All the while I am thinking back to my own version of events of the past few years and the parallels I could draw and realize how much more than a mother she is. What these conversations do for me is help me expand my view of my mom to more than just that one-dimensional aspect of being mother. I learn a little more about what she loved doing, her motivations and perspectives.</p>\n<p>The stories she tells draw out time in a way by bringing the choices of others to influence my existence at this moment in time stretching as well as into the lives of many of those after me. That life is uneasy, rarely takes the form of a straight line is a recurrent theme in our conversations. Without being explicit, she hints that I will have to brave the unknowable future – with faith – evident in how she herself took on challenges with grace.</p>\n<p>With the lot of advice given to me before I left for America – some in passing and most alluded within the jokes, goodbyes and prayers, my mother then and even now in our talks tells me that I am the best. Although she has and always had the best intentions in mind, I begin to wonder how this kind of affirmation translates to knowing how to brave the tough times when things are out of control or when I fail. How will I find the courage to come to speak to her during the difficult moments when she projects a version of me that falls seems flawless? Each time after these conversations that I have had with my mother, I think it is necessary that I do hear the stories of her ambitions, joys as well as the trials in her life as the listening saves me from thinking that my own shortcomings are too big to overcome, that I should as well celebrate each small victory in my life</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

Be wary of simplifications and too much complexity. Even more, centrist conclusions for how we wrestle with an idea is particularly suspicious and may be flavored sometimes with anger, other times with pain and at times with hope just to make them that more palatable. Probe each argument, metaphor and choice of words. The questions are almost always more important than what answers they solicit – how each is framed, the assumptions each makes, who it includes and leaves out, what follows next. Think ahead and try to guess where I am taking you and if I take you somewhere else, I will have had something to offer. If the words remain in your mind, the writing was an intellectual process; if they move you, I will have done my part. I will be biased and shortsighted, eccentric and cunning. Therefore, I am asking you to do some hard but necessary work when reading me and every day in what you see, read and share – the kind of deep personal work that remains of each of us.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

When I wrapped myself around my sheets at the happiest times, or when I hugged my body during the darkest of moments and even when there was nothing else to do but stare into thin air to try and eke out a sense of the world around me, I took down notes. Whether that is the most characteristic of me, some will say yes.</p>\n<p>Ask me what I think is the most pressing issue for me, and I pause, then stutter between, one: the upside and downsides of my “born-tao” (brought up in the city) childhood growing up in an ethnically diverse community and two: bridging the gaps in technology, education and empowerment for women, men and the poor in the society. Where all this becomes possible is through understanding what it takes to build an idea from concept to product and to then leverage the designs that are not only elegant but also consider other points of view.</p>\n<p>The simplest way I can describe the intersection between having an inclination to write poetry and code is that each is a an attempt to bridge the gap between the inconsistencies that presents themselves in the world that we exist in today. By acknowledging the brokenness in systems, recognizing how fragmented and diverse human desire is – then I find the courage to begin to look into the gaps, plough through my own apathy and cynicism.</p>\n<p>Lingering on this very question – of where the intersection lies between poetic eye and debugging code is a slope undefined for several reasons. One is tempted, as I have, to draw clear distinctions of where the former ends and the latter begins – a line so faint that when staring into it too much, it can feel crystal one day and maddeningly blurred the very next. Both are ways to escape into imagination. Yet neither can deliver what they promise fully and most of the time it ends up unfinished business and so, they both are a good lesson in learning when and how to look away. And so some days – most in actual sense – it feels as though my left and right eye are seeing two different renderings of reality, and I fear they may never reconcile fully.</p>\n<p>&quot;Everyday each of us invents the world and the self who meets that world, opens up or closes down space for others within that.&quot; - Rebecca Solnit</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

It is to me, one of the most compelling feelings yet the reality of what I face each time. How I circulate the differing fluid feels that emanate from the extremities to the heart is a path clouded. There are ways I have dissociated the body from the mind, from the spirit, from the emotions, from the earth – in ways that make me wake up each morning and try to collect these parts of me. If I’d like, I put on some way that I’d like to look, place in my bag notes that I never read but that remind me I used to once collected, place aside my Kenyanness because it won’t be needed, decide I want to smell a little nicer and watch myself walk to take the school bus. I never felt so divided up yet fitted all into one. I feel that I need to feel the earth below my feet but there’s so much I don’t know about the earth that I am walking on. If you look close enough at the eyes – they give it all away.</p>\n<p>I chase memory.</p>\n<p>No longer do I record moments because they, in part, I tend to plan to go out, plan to eat, plan to dance, and recording thrusts me into trying to control the past in the present. Give me time, this is where I am. I will learn again to forget.</p>\n<p>Being in temporary disarray happens more often than I would like. And when I consider context, I reason to blame dislocation from memory. My past roots became upset and tried to adjust to new ground. Deep they sank into the self, only to unearth fears and dreams I have to consider giving up for a future that wants to etch itself onto me. I gaze, and my mouth wriggles into the shape shame if I bend to it.</p>\n<p>For the best. They reckon.</p>\n<p>Everyone out there – beating out their chests and wrapping warmly their seductive selves. So hangs the overcast skies. Bidding for the rain to plunder the earth with tears that ache.</p>\n<p>I look up so the sky will replace my dried up ducts.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n            <author>lbugasu@gmail.com (Laurence B.

The practice reminds me of high school when I didn’t have the luxury of steamy personal bathrooms but rather run-down swaths of stalls – some of which didn’t work entirely. Toward the end of my junior year, we were lucky to have one or two of the stalls installed with running hot water – but even with the option to take a hot shower in the morning, I at times preferred the chilling water to awaken myself to a new day.</p>\\\\n<p>Of all the past winters I’ve experienced, this past winter was also a time when I was trying to figure out my career, my faith, writing, family, friends and more. Most of that is still work in progress – I&#39;m writing again – which I’m happy about. The opportunity intern at Antra, a consulting company, has been a process of learning. I recently also became a daily coffee drinker which I didn’t ever see coming. I still convince a part of myself that it’s not an addiction.</p>\\\\n<p>At the beginning of this very past winter, the was a kind of longing that hung in the air as I moved back to New York. This longing was for the certain past – the good and the bad as well as the future – always a time to look forward to and hope. This longing was at times deep and frustrating and at other times faded amidst the daily rhythms and rituals. Past victories and failures are both in themselves alluring. The former because I can easily hold them too close and close my eyes to what lays before me, now. The latter because I can also easily jump back right into them and stimy any progress I made to learn from my mistakes. However, the most attractive thing about the past is that the past has a certainty to it – it&#39;s complete and bound up in itself. How I badly wanted that – the certainty that the past could offer.</p>\\\\n<p>The future holds hope as an appeal. Often at times I tend to want to feed into that hope now – by doing what I can to make the future become the present. At times I don’t want to wait – why wait for something so deeply attractive as a future. The risk here is, I think far more dangerous because I may then become frustrated and dissatisfied with the work I need to do to get there. The work needed to get there remains very much so in the present. I am writing all this as a reminder to myself that the living part is very much in the now.</p>\\\\n<p>As a side note, I’ve also been trying new recipes. Although I have tried different recipes, my beef stew isn’t quite there yet as last weekend I skipped the tomatoes and added too much water but managed to salvage a meal for my room mates.</p>\\\\n<p>That’s it for now, but I hope to share more in the future.</p>\\\\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/journal/dawn\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Dawn\\\",\\n            \\\"summary\\\": \\\"I turn the faucet all the way to the right for the last few seconds of my shower – a ritual I have taken up this past winter.

Do I have the courage to fall is the all important question.</p>\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/journal/sinking\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Sinking\\\",\\n            \\\"summary\\\": \\\"I sink Into patterns, A slow agony of todos and expectations, Demanding of me, wanting from me, What I do not seem to have, but questions of: What not to do, what to prioritize, When to sleep?\\\",\\n            \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/post-images/sinking.jpg\\\",\\n            \\\"date_modified\\\": \\\"2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n            \\\"author\\\": {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Laurence B.

Rather than my existence being centered around the color of my skin, the question I often asked was some flavor of “how do I tell stories that portray the diversity and complexity of our people?” To answer this question, I needed to look back in order to look ahead. Although colonization was motivated by the idea of one group of people being of lesser value viewed as lower than another, this concept of caste is not only remnant but has morphed into bitter and negative ethnicity among Kenyan tribes. The color of my skin, then, was just a happenstance even as it took much more meaning in college.</p>\\\\n<p>In general, English places adjectives before the subject unlike Swahili or French (the later that I spoke since 14), . So, what ends up happening is that in describing a person, their skin color is pointed out before we know that subject is first and foremost a person. With an attempt then, to place the person before the color of their skin (a person who is black as opposed to a black person), I witnessed the slight dissociation of skin color from becoming the defining characteristic of a person. I can therefore be a human being before I am black, I can be a man before I am black, I can be a Kenyan before I am black. Since in Kenya there was no concept of being black, I began to try to understand Black America, through conversation, the media, and readings. Back home, there is a loose concept of blackness and so, as I asked myself the question of “how do I move through this space as a black person,” I found myself having to stop and think in a state of mind that did not occur naturally to me. To have to think about the tone of my voice, the cadence of my speech, how my feet bounced off the ground, how my hands and neck revealed my body language, whether, if in fact, I was a danger to anyone was exhausting. I think of how my female friends talked about how they work against the grain of a misogynist culture, how they have to be aware of their senses because you can never be too careful. How then could I weave my identity as a person of color while sustaining my Kenyan heritage, and could the two exist in concert?</p>\\\\n<p>It was in the fall of 2016 that I became awakened to the color my skin having implications on how I moved through spaces. More and more, I began to see how the color of one’s skin can be a reference point to the kinds of lives that could be extrapolated solely from what color that is. How black America was presented was very much a culture as well as the stories that are attached to its invention. To be black was also taking up and actualizing an identity from the color of my skin. Superficial blackness is for instance, cool, slick, having that delicate bounce and smooth swagger. The deeper work was internal – from understanding my relationship with my skin – learning how to take care of it in the cold and dry winters and reaffirming its affinity to the warm tropical weather. I was growing out my hair since the end of high school and taking delight in how it looked up with its coarse texture. And this process intrigued me, along with the idea of becoming black. An African such as I could empathize with the African American history of being enslaved and discriminated against, judged, lynched because of the color of one’s skin. But in as much as this dark history seemed to take center stage in discussions and conversations about racism against African Americans, there were stories of tremendous triumph, stories of black enterprise and far-reaching cultural movements in music, art and literature among others. Whether I could juggle these two aspects as well as discover other manifestations of the black experience remains an unresolved journey. Three realities emerged. There were environments where I became fully conscious of the color of my skin, there were also spaces where I could forget the color of my skin mattered and there were situations where the consciousness and lack thereof existed in a kind of tug of war.</p>\\\\n<p>There is a kind of inward gaze about black America to which I observed: that the story of the black America is often centered on his experience and how that experience shapes his worldview. For me, a Kenyan who looked outward into the world, and from the outward gaze into America, the process of looking inside led me, first, to take a closer look at how I was raised and how that upbringing did, if in any way, shape my black experience; and secondly, to begin to pay attention to how I navigate different spaces and social situations and how this navigation is informed by (a) my being a man and (b) having black skin. Very quickly after I arrived in New York that Fall of 2016, I became more aware of how, as a black man, could walk the streets of New York at odd hours of the night and carry little fear – unlike some of my fellow female friends who kept mentioning the amount of caution that they exercised in the city at night. With the #MeToo movement, various celebrities, and public figures, primarily men, began facing the consequences of taking advantage of their power and influence to assault and/or take advantage of women. This calling out of men couple with conversations with others, as well as reading, began to open my eyes to the power dynamics that exist when I interact with women and how much work there still remains to be done, especially back home, for men to understand how it is also up to them, not only women, to examine the ways they are brought up to view women. While growing up there was a lack of direct conversation surrounding what it means to be a man, I took mental notes from my father who was a preacher/minister and an academic, in that order. Looking then, into my blackness, I defaulted towards my faith and my upbringing – neither of which seemed to provide adequate fodder for my nascent conceptualizations of Black America. Black America needed me, a man with black skin, to keep engaging with its gripping past to bring myself to an understanding of its present form in daily life.</p>\\\\n<p>Toni Morrison, in her book, The Origin of Others talks about how easy it is to estrange others. I think about this idea of Othering, how many times I have made it possible for someone to feel different, how deliberate as well as easy this act can be – to not listen deeply, to make lazy assumptions, to not want to know someone’s experience, to put value to one person over another. I think again of how simple the process of seeing the world with my eyes alone. “Why should we want to close the distance when we can close the gate?” – Morrison asks. Yet, to the many who have stretched themselves to me, it has been a selfless gift as well as a humanizing and healing process. How much more, then, am I to give an ear, to take a pause, be open to another point of view, step into the discomfort and know another?</p>\\\\n<p>Credit to one dear friend who helped me edit this piece.</p>\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/journal/thinking-about-the-color-of-my-skin\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Thinking About The Color of My Skin\\\",\\n            \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Coming from the East of Africa, I grew up without a perception that my skin came with a certain sense of existence different from others.

As we speak, my intention is to learn more about her and that, eventually, she can learn more about me. She shares stories of how she met my father and studied in America. She tells me of her joyous and happy moments as well as her struggles and mistakes. All the while I am thinking back to my own version of events of the past few years and the parallels I could draw and realize how much more than a mother she is. What these conversations do for me is help me expand my view of my mom to more than just that one-dimensional aspect of being mother. I learn a little more about what she loved doing, her motivations and perspectives.</p>\\\\n<p>The stories she tells draw out time in a way by bringing the choices of others to influence my existence at this moment in time stretching as well as into the lives of many of those after me.

Although she has and always had the best intentions in mind, I begin to wonder how this kind of affirmation translates to knowing how to brave the tough times when things are out of control or when I fail. How will I find the courage to come to speak to her during the difficult moments when she projects a version of me that falls seems flawless? Each time after these conversations that I have had with my mother, I think it is necessary that I do hear the stories of her ambitions, joys as well as the trials in her life as the listening saves me from thinking that my own shortcomings are too big to overcome, that I should as well celebrate each small victory in my life</p>\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/journal/chicken-soup\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Chicken Soup\\\",\\n            \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Ibegin to meet with my mother on call each week in the Summer during the pandemic and we decide to talk about anything and everything.

When I wrapped myself around my sheets at the happiest times, or when I hugged my body during the darkest of moments and even when there was nothing else to do but stare into thin air to try and eke out a sense of the world around me, I took down notes. Whether that is the most characteristic of me, some will say yes.</p>\\\\n<p>Ask me what I think is the most pressing issue for me, and I pause, then stutter between, one: the upside and downsides of my “born-tao” (brought up in the city) childhood growing up in an ethnically diverse community and two: bridging the gaps in technology, education and empowerment for women, men and the poor in the society. Where all this becomes possible is through understanding what it takes to build an idea from concept to product and to then leverage the designs that are not only elegant but also consider other points of view.</p>\\\\n<p>The simplest way I can describe the intersection between having an inclination to write poetry and code is that each is a an attempt to bridge the gap between the inconsistencies that presents themselves in the world that we exist in today. By acknowledging the brokenness in systems, recognizing how fragmented and diverse human desire is – then I find the courage to begin to look into the gaps, plough through my own apathy and cynicism.</p>\\\\n<p>Lingering on this very question – of where the intersection lies between poetic eye and debugging code is a slope undefined for several reasons. One is tempted, as I have, to draw clear distinctions of where the former ends and the latter begins – a line so faint that when staring into it too much, it can feel crystal one day and maddeningly blurred the very next. Both are ways to escape into imagination. Yet neither can deliver what they promise fully and most of the time it ends up unfinished business and so, they both are a good lesson in learning when and how to look away. And so some days – most in actual sense – it feels as though my left and right eye are seeing two different renderings of reality, and I fear they may never reconcile fully.</p>\\\\n<p>&quot;Everyday each of us invents the world and the self who meets that world, opens up or closes down space for others within that.&quot; - Rebecca Solnit</p>\\\\n\\\",\\n            \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/journal/looking-into-the-gaps\\\",\\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Looking Into The Gaps\\\",\\n            \\\"summary\\\": \\\"As a means of expression, I see writing to be a medium to clarify my thoughts, to work through experiences and to conceptualize meaning and make sense. \\\",\\n            \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://www.laudebugs.me/post-images/looking-into-the-gaps.jpg\\\",\\n            \\\"date_modified\\\": \\\"2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n            \\\"author\\\": {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Laurence B.

The practice reminds me of high school when I didn’t have the luxury of steamy personal bathrooms but rather run-down swaths of stalls – some of which didn’t work entirely. Toward the end of my junior year, we were lucky to have one or two of the stalls installed with running hot water – but even with the option to take a hot shower in the morning, I at times preferred the chilling water to awaken myself to a new day.</p>\n<p>Of all the past winters I’ve experienced, this past winter was also a time when I was trying to figure out my career, my faith, writing, family, friends and more. Most of that is still work in progress – I&#39;m writing again – which I’m happy about. The opportunity intern at Antra, a consulting company, has been a process of learning. I recently also became a daily coffee drinker which I didn’t ever see coming. I still convince a part of myself that it’s not an addiction.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of this very past winter, the was a kind of longing that hung in the air as I moved back to New York. This longing was for the certain past – the good and the bad as well as the future – always a time to look forward to and hope. This longing was at times deep and frustrating and at other times faded amidst the daily rhythms and rituals. Past victories and failures are both in themselves alluring. The former because I can easily hold them too close and close my eyes to what lays before me, now. The latter because I can also easily jump back right into them and stimy any progress I made to learn from my mistakes. However, the most attractive thing about the past is that the past has a certainty to it – it&#39;s complete and bound up in itself. How I badly wanted that – the certainty that the past could offer.</p>\n<p>The future holds hope as an appeal. Often at times I tend to want to feed into that hope now – by doing what I can to make the future become the present. At times I don’t want to wait – why wait for something so deeply attractive as a future. The risk here is, I think far more dangerous because I may then become frustrated and dissatisfied with the work I need to do to get there. The work needed to get there remains very much so in the present. I am writing all this as a reminder to myself that the living part is very much in the now.</p>\n<p>As a side note, I’ve also been trying new recipes. Although I have tried different recipes, my beef stew isn’t quite there yet as last weekend I skipped the tomatoes and added too much water but managed to salvage a meal for my room mates.</p>\n<p>That’s it for now, but I hope to share more in the future.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

Rather than my existence being centered around the color of my skin, the question I often asked was some flavor of “how do I tell stories that portray the diversity and complexity of our people?” To answer this question, I needed to look back in order to look ahead. Although colonization was motivated by the idea of one group of people being of lesser value viewed as lower than another, this concept of caste is not only remnant but has morphed into bitter and negative ethnicity among Kenyan tribes. The color of my skin, then, was just a happenstance even as it took much more meaning in college.</p>\n<p>In general, English places adjectives before the subject unlike Swahili or French (the later that I spoke since 14), . So, what ends up happening is that in describing a person, their skin color is pointed out before we know that subject is first and foremost a person. With an attempt then, to place the person before the color of their skin (a person who is black as opposed to a black person), I witnessed the slight dissociation of skin color from becoming the defining characteristic of a person. I can therefore be a human being before I am black, I can be a man before I am black, I can be a Kenyan before I am black. Since in Kenya there was no concept of being black, I began to try to understand Black America, through conversation, the media, and readings. Back home, there is a loose concept of blackness and so, as I asked myself the question of “how do I move through this space as a black person,” I found myself having to stop and think in a state of mind that did not occur naturally to me. To have to think about the tone of my voice, the cadence of my speech, how my feet bounced off the ground, how my hands and neck revealed my body language, whether, if in fact, I was a danger to anyone was exhausting. I think of how my female friends talked about how they work against the grain of a misogynist culture, how they have to be aware of their senses because you can never be too careful. How then could I weave my identity as a person of color while sustaining my Kenyan heritage, and could the two exist in concert?</p>\n<p>It was in the fall of 2016 that I became awakened to the color my skin having implications on how I moved through spaces. More and more, I began to see how the color of one’s skin can be a reference point to the kinds of lives that could be extrapolated solely from what color that is. How black America was presented was very much a culture as well as the stories that are attached to its invention. To be black was also taking up and actualizing an identity from the color of my skin. Superficial blackness is for instance, cool, slick, having that delicate bounce and smooth swagger. The deeper work was internal – from understanding my relationship with my skin – learning how to take care of it in the cold and dry winters and reaffirming its affinity to the warm tropical weather. I was growing out my hair since the end of high school and taking delight in how it looked up with its coarse texture. And this process intrigued me, along with the idea of becoming black. An African such as I could empathize with the African American history of being enslaved and discriminated against, judged, lynched because of the color of one’s skin. But in as much as this dark history seemed to take center stage in discussions and conversations about racism against African Americans, there were stories of tremendous triumph, stories of black enterprise and far-reaching cultural movements in music, art and literature among others. Whether I could juggle these two aspects as well as discover other manifestations of the black experience remains an unresolved journey. Three realities emerged. There were environments where I became fully conscious of the color of my skin, there were also spaces where I could forget the color of my skin mattered and there were situations where the consciousness and lack thereof existed in a kind of tug of war.</p>\n<p>There is a kind of inward gaze about black America to which I observed: that the story of the black America is often centered on his experience and how that experience shapes his worldview. For me, a Kenyan who looked outward into the world, and from the outward gaze into America, the process of looking inside led me, first, to take a closer look at how I was raised and how that upbringing did, if in any way, shape my black experience; and secondly, to begin to pay attention to how I navigate different spaces and social situations and how this navigation is informed by (a) my being a man and (b) having black skin. Very quickly after I arrived in New York that Fall of 2016, I became more aware of how, as a black man, could walk the streets of New York at odd hours of the night and carry little fear – unlike some of my fellow female friends who kept mentioning the amount of caution that they exercised in the city at night. With the #MeToo movement, various celebrities, and public figures, primarily men, began facing the consequences of taking advantage of their power and influence to assault and/or take advantage of women. This calling out of men couple with conversations with others, as well as reading, began to open my eyes to the power dynamics that exist when I interact with women and how much work there still remains to be done, especially back home, for men to understand how it is also up to them, not only women, to examine the ways they are brought up to view women. While growing up there was a lack of direct conversation surrounding what it means to be a man, I took mental notes from my father who was a preacher/minister and an academic, in that order. Looking then, into my blackness, I defaulted towards my faith and my upbringing – neither of which seemed to provide adequate fodder for my nascent conceptualizations of Black America. Black America needed me, a man with black skin, to keep engaging with its gripping past to bring myself to an understanding of its present form in daily life.</p>\n<p>Toni Morrison, in her book, The Origin of Others talks about how easy it is to estrange others. I think about this idea of Othering, how many times I have made it possible for someone to feel different, how deliberate as well as easy this act can be – to not listen deeply, to make lazy assumptions, to not want to know someone’s experience, to put value to one person over another. I think again of how simple the process of seeing the world with my eyes alone. “Why should we want to close the distance when we can close the gate?” – Morrison asks. Yet, to the many who have stretched themselves to me, it has been a selfless gift as well as a humanizing and healing process. How much more, then, am I to give an ear, to take a pause, be open to another point of view, step into the discomfort and know another?</p>\n<p>Credit to one dear friend who helped me edit this piece.</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

The days are now here and there marked by rain, the shrinking daylight, and later the deadening of leaves. This September my mother turns sixty. The more I remember that, the more I try to remember when she turned 50 or 45 and the kinds of things that happened in between those years and think that I would want to white out some parts and keep others. But again, it’s September and how can I not let this month pass by yet is stands between me and the rest of the year; between me and thinking of the uncertainty what’s to come. But even more so than ever, each day that is not closely watched can turn into a week and month passing by and forgotten and so I want to note that I am here now, in September, watching the birds make their enclaves outside my window the heat claiming more of the morning and the people stepping into their forays. Oh, but how can I grab on to this month and not let it slip?</p>\n<p>I begin a schedule – early mornings and perhaps I won’t spend too much time thinking about regressing into lax streaks. I’m trying to bring our conversations down to earth with a friend because they risk being over there and not in the moment and wonder how to do this without being too introspective. I am reading, and writing, listening, learning to get across what I mean to say. Tomorrow I will run. Though there’s still today that just only began. Only just reared its head and let’s deal with this day first.</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

As we speak, my intention is to learn more about her and that, eventually, she can learn more about me. She shares stories of how she met my father and studied in America. She tells me of her joyous and happy moments as well as her struggles and mistakes. All the while I am thinking back to my own version of events of the past few years and the parallels I could draw and realize how much more than a mother she is. What these conversations do for me is help me expand my view of my mom to more than just that one-dimensional aspect of being mother. I learn a little more about what she loved doing, her motivations and perspectives.</p>\n<p>The stories she tells draw out time in a way by bringing the choices of others to influence my existence at this moment in time stretching as well as into the lives of many of those after me. That life is uneasy, rarely takes the form of a straight line is a recurrent theme in our conversations. Without being explicit, she hints that I will have to brave the unknowable future – with faith – evident in how she herself took on challenges with grace.</p>\n<p>With the lot of advice given to me before I left for America – some in passing and most alluded within the jokes, goodbyes and prayers, my mother then and even now in our talks tells me that I am the best. Although she has and always had the best intentions in mind, I begin to wonder how this kind of affirmation translates to knowing how to brave the tough times when things are out of control or when I fail. How will I find the courage to come to speak to her during the difficult moments when she projects a version of me that falls seems flawless? Each time after these conversations that I have had with my mother, I think it is necessary that I do hear the stories of her ambitions, joys as well as the trials in her life as the listening saves me from thinking that my own shortcomings are too big to overcome, that I should as well celebrate each small victory in my life</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

Be wary of simplifications and too much complexity. Even more, centrist conclusions for how we wrestle with an idea is particularly suspicious and may be flavored sometimes with anger, other times with pain and at times with hope just to make them that more palatable. Probe each argument, metaphor and choice of words. The questions are almost always more important than what answers they solicit – how each is framed, the assumptions each makes, who it includes and leaves out, what follows next. Think ahead and try to guess where I am taking you and if I take you somewhere else, I will have had something to offer. If the words remain in your mind, the writing was an intellectual process; if they move you, I will have done my part. I will be biased and shortsighted, eccentric and cunning. Therefore, I am asking you to do some hard but necessary work when reading me and every day in what you see, read and share – the kind of deep personal work that remains of each of us.</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

When I wrapped myself around my sheets at the happiest times, or when I hugged my body during the darkest of moments and even when there was nothing else to do but stare into thin air to try and eke out a sense of the world around me, I took down notes. Whether that is the most characteristic of me, some will say yes.</p>\n<p>Ask me what I think is the most pressing issue for me, and I pause, then stutter between, one: the upside and downsides of my “born-tao” (brought up in the city) childhood growing up in an ethnically diverse community and two: bridging the gaps in technology, education and empowerment for women, men and the poor in the society. Where all this becomes possible is through understanding what it takes to build an idea from concept to product and to then leverage the designs that are not only elegant but also consider other points of view.</p>\n<p>The simplest way I can describe the intersection between having an inclination to write poetry and code is that each is a an attempt to bridge the gap between the inconsistencies that presents themselves in the world that we exist in today. By acknowledging the brokenness in systems, recognizing how fragmented and diverse human desire is – then I find the courage to begin to look into the gaps, plough through my own apathy and cynicism.</p>\n<p>Lingering on this very question – of where the intersection lies between poetic eye and debugging code is a slope undefined for several reasons. One is tempted, as I have, to draw clear distinctions of where the former ends and the latter begins – a line so faint that when staring into it too much, it can feel crystal one day and maddeningly blurred the very next. Both are ways to escape into imagination. Yet neither can deliver what they promise fully and most of the time it ends up unfinished business and so, they both are a good lesson in learning when and how to look away. And so some days – most in actual sense – it feels as though my left and right eye are seeing two different renderings of reality, and I fear they may never reconcile fully.</p>\n<p>&quot;Everyday each of us invents the world and the self who meets that world, opens up or closes down space for others within that.&quot; - Rebecca Solnit</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.

It is to me, one of the most compelling feelings yet the reality of what I face each time. How I circulate the differing fluid feels that emanate from the extremities to the heart is a path clouded. There are ways I have dissociated the body from the mind, from the spirit, from the emotions, from the earth – in ways that make me wake up each morning and try to collect these parts of me. If I’d like, I put on some way that I’d like to look, place in my bag notes that I never read but that remind me I used to once collected, place aside my Kenyanness because it won’t be needed, decide I want to smell a little nicer and watch myself walk to take the school bus. I never felt so divided up yet fitted all into one. I feel that I need to feel the earth below my feet but there’s so much I don’t know about the earth that I am walking on. If you look close enough at the eyes – they give it all away.</p>\n<p>I chase memory.</p>\n<p>No longer do I record moments because they, in part, I tend to plan to go out, plan to eat, plan to dance, and recording thrusts me into trying to control the past in the present. Give me time, this is where I am. I will learn again to forget.</p>\n<p>Being in temporary disarray happens more often than I would like. And when I consider context, I reason to blame dislocation from memory. My past roots became upset and tried to adjust to new ground. Deep they sank into the self, only to unearth fears and dreams I have to consider giving up for a future that wants to etch itself onto me. I gaze, and my mouth wriggles into the shape shame if I bend to it.</p>\n<p>For the best. They reckon.</p>\n<p>Everyone out there – beating out their chests and wrapping warmly their seductive selves. So hangs the overcast skies. Bidding for the rain to plunder the earth with tears that ache.</p>\n<p>I look up so the sky will replace my dried up ducts.</p>\n]]></content>\n        <author>\n            <name>Laurence B.
