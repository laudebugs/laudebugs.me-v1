And it’s almost as if I left through the back door.
The sense of escaping what I knew to be how things were supposed to end.
How are things supposed to end? With expectations forcing actions into predefined paths.
Of all the ways that I imagined my four years of college turning out, I didn’t think that they would turn out with me not graduating on time, with no job, and staying over at a friend’s place for an extended period of time.
The overwhelming feeling last Spring after having finished the semester was the that of defeat.
Now, as has been a couple of times before, it’s more of indirection. What do I want to do in life, what kind of job do I want to pursue?
