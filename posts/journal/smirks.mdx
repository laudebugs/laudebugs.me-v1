summary: 'I am stuck thus Gone are the spaces where I lie. Where does truth become a lie Becoming has a sly tune to it maybe because I realize I needed to be naive in the first place and what happens is When no-one but me can see I find it harder and harder to speak, to tell, to describe, to know The places I go become the spaces I grow Out of myself and into myself – pushing past forms of me, letting new ones take root, but the old – that part that remains, in memory, in the scars, in the diary entries, the Layers and bones of the past forms don’t simply sit still. They Hobble and steal fragrances that I spared bringing them back like it was yesterday'

I am stuck thus Gone are the spaces where I lie. Where does truth become a lie Becoming has a sly tune to it maybe because I realize I needed to be naive in the first place and what happens is When no-one but me can see I find it harder and harder to speak, to tell, to describe, to know The places I go become the spaces I grow Out of myself and into myself – pushing past forms of me, letting new ones take root, but the old – that part that remains, in memory, in the scars, in the diary entries, the Layers and bones of the past forms don’t simply sit still. They Hobble and steal fragrances that I spared bringing them back like it was yesterday

how easy Essences weave into skin, from memory, into the present,

Forming shapes and escapes into The wind that blows away memories and hopes I attempt to replace.

i Best be prepped for death in the many ways it comes. The Angel is holding her breath, letting her teeth sink into her lips, Awaiting a slip of a step, expectations can change the outcome, and even those I hide, find their way out, hungrier, fiercer to achieve their aim, If … when I failed to pay attention, [the lot of] demons bid for [my] skin. Can I Allow [my]self one fine glance to salvation’s hope in prayers I already lost many days ago, or will I give someone the final dance, before I allow my soul to sink into rubble. Steep slopes emerge and so does any grip of fading lines that were once thick and clear. to get to where my gods really want, I let thin ropes merge my desire and transgression Empty hopes diverge and there’s not just one path, but many that lead nowhere. I paste my disfigured portrait Onto faces and the like and all I get in return is a letting go of grains of myself that fall between the cracks. for this person I become, Family’s never been too close yet too far gone. Voices bring more silence as they scream on the inside. not. out. On the walls are pictures, previous versions of the us stuck in time, events to commit to memory, But down and under brews peace, love and disunity.
