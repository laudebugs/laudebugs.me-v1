I know – for a fact! from whence I be.

The earth sentenced me to foraging the dust until I’ve bored deep into the skin;

Playing the part of becoming something else.

Compromise is easy.

For the moments now barrage what could be.

To go back may be the only way to move forward.

Baba, I will bring you that which I promised:

A heart full of unfulfilled desires.

What you told me though,

I seem to let go the more I think of staying.

I don’t own the tissues wrapping my shell together.

Should I let alternate ideas get birthed in me,

I know not where they lead.
