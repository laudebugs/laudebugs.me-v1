It is imperative for you look beyond my words for truth. Be wary of simplifications and too much complexity. Even more, centrist conclusions for how we wrestle with an idea is particularly suspicious and may be flavored sometimes with anger, other times with pain and at times with hope just to make them that more palatable. Probe each argument, metaphor and choice of words. The questions are almost always more important than what answers they solicit – how each is framed, the assumptions each makes, who it includes and leaves out, what follows next. Think ahead and try to guess where I am taking you and if I take you somewhere else, I will have had something to offer. If the words remain in your mind, the writing was an intellectual process; if they move you, I will have done my part. I will be biased and shortsighted, eccentric and cunning. Therefore, I am asking you to do some hard but necessary work when reading me and every day in what you see, read and share – the kind of deep personal work that remains of each of us.
