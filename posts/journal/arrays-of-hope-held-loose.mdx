There is a lot that’s going on. A lot of disarray within our composed lives that ask us to retract from what we know about ourselves and others and our worlds. Different forms of us emerge, perhaps for revealing what frames need testing, understanding.

Funneling this energy, emotion and body into meaning is a task that’s ridiculously slippery. And I for one, in fits and starts, only begin to scratch the surface – confronting the truths, the histories, the stories that I weave.

And holding on to these hopes I have with not the whys that inform them, how they form, what makes them persist is letting them stick loose enough to be move, shift, evolve while I look away.

It’s the kind of thirst that only God can fill – fully – completely – dwelling in him. The next months will be dedicated to this exposition of the attitudes, hopes and joys, pain and brokenness that describe lives of pursuits.
